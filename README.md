## Description

[NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/) template project with predefined features like validation,
database setup, error handling, containerization, modularity and many more,
with the purpose of enabling rapid development, where developers don't need
to perform individual, and potentially different, setups for each project.

## Installation & running

We are using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as our containerization tool in order to avoid
conflicts between different environments and OSs.

In order to install and run this application you need to `git clone` this project into
your local environment.

After that, you'll need to create your own `.env` file, the easiest way is to copy existing
`.env.example` into your new `.env` file, and change environment variables values according to your needs:
```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Next step, you need to build the docker image and run the container:
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

This command will read configuration from `docker-compose.yml` and perform image building and container running,
with all needed services defined there.

`-d` flag stands for `Detached Mode` which means the container will run without a need for open terminal session/window.

If you need to rebuild the image and container, you can add `--build` flag, like this:
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

If you need to recreate the image from the scratch, ignoring the cache, do it like this:
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d --build --force-create
```

If you need to restart the container, do so like this:
```bash
$ docker-compose restart
```

When you are done with the work you need to stop the containers:
```bash
$ docker-compose down
```

If you need to trace the logs in the runtime of the service, eg. `api` service that is defined
in `docker-compose.yml` file, you can do it like this:
```bash
$ docker-compose logs -f api
```

If you need to perform some command inside target container, eg. for `api` service and `ls -la` command,
you can do it like this:
```bash
$ docker-compose exec api sh -c "ls -la"
```

## About the app/project

### Package manager
We are using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as our package manager for this application.

### Environment/config variables
This section explains the purpose of defined environment variables and what they represent:

- `APP_ENV`: The environment in which the application is running. Most common are `local`, `development`, `production`.
- `APP_PORT`: Port that is open inside the docker container, the inner port, the one which nestjs app listens to.
- `APP_OUT_PORT`: Port that is open for the outside world, that is accessible publicly.
- `APP_DEBUG_PORT`: Debug port that is open inside docker container, the inner port
- `APP_DEBUG_OUT_PORT`: Debug port that is open for the outside world, this port is used for debug configuration for devs IDEs.
- `DB_HOST`: Host, IP or domain name of your database.
- `DB_PORT`: Database port that is open inside docker container.
- `DB_OUT_PORT`: Database port that is open for the outside world, that is accessible publicly.
- `DB_USER`: Database user that will have access to database in name of app.
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Password for the database user.
- `DB_NAME`: Database name for this app.

### CLI Commands
This project introduces the usage of custom CLI commands with the help of [nestjs-command](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nestjs-command) library.
Register commands as described in the link, and you can execute it with `yarn command <COMMAND_NAME>`.

### Database and migrations
In order to version and synchronize database schemas throughout different environments we are using database migrations mechanism.

We are using [Umzug](https://github.com/sequelize/umzug) library behind database migrations functionalities.

If you want to create new migration (you'll probably need to perform that inside docker container), do it like:
```bash
$ docker-compose exec api sh -c "yarn db:migration:create <MIGRATION_NAME>"
```
If you want to execute migrations and update the database schema, do it like:
```bash
$ docker-compose exec api sh -c "yarn db:migrate"
```
If you want to revert executed migrations, do it like:
```bash
$ docker-compose exec api sh -c "yarn db:migrate:down"
```

### Validation
Also, we enhanced the format of the thrown validation errors, and instead of getting plain list of 
errors in string format you will get additional metadata about every validation error, even for the nested objects and arrays.
So if you send and validate some object like this:
```json
{
  "age": "202",
  "items": [
    {
      "meta": {
        "author": "",
        "url": ""
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

You should get this as an output:
```json
{
    "statusCode": 400,
    "message": [
        {
            "property": "age",
            "violations": {
                "max": "age must not be greater than 100",
                "isNumber": "age must be a number conforming to the specified constraints"
            }
        },
        {
          "property": "items.0.title",
          "violations": {
            "isString": "title must be a string",
            "isNotEmpty": "title should not be empty"
          }
        },
        {
            "property": "items.0.meta.author",
            "violations": {
                "isNotEmpty": "author should not be empty"
            }
        },
        {
            "property": "items.0.meta.url",
            "violations": {
                "isString": "url must be a string"
            }
        }
    ],
    "error": "Bad Request"
}
```
This way you can easily map and target the errors of nested properties, so you can avoid handling
the errors recursively.

### Code linting
We use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to make our code more readable and unified.

`prettier` should be already running in the background while you code,
but it's always good to prettify your code before the final commit and push:
```bash
$ yarn format
```

Also, we have zero tolerance towards errors and warnings that come out as `eslint` command output.
The command for eslinting is:
```bash
$ yarn lint
```

And whatever errors or warnings come out as a result, we have to address them.

## Testing

### Unit testing
The idea of unit testing is to test your units (classes, methods, functions, etc.) in isolated mini-environment,
where it doesn't depend on any dependency, meaning the dependencies of these classes should be faked or mocked,
so you don't actually trigger or call the functions of dependent, because in unit tests we are just testing the public methods
and members of the class, without actually contacting the class it depends on.

In order to unit test your application, you need to cover your controllers, services, repositories and similar classes with unit tests,
suffixed with `.spec.ts` phrase (eg. `example.service.spec.ts`). To run them type:
```shell
$ yarn test
```
or in container:
```shell
$ docker-compose exec api sh -c "yarn test"
```

### e2e / API testing
The idea of e2e/API testing is to test your resources and endpoints against some test data and payloads, and you should aim to cover most crucial scenarios
that can occur in your endpoints (`20x` and `40x`) statuses.

In order to perform API testing against your HTTP endpoints you can do it in two ways:
- You can run:
    ```shell
      $ docker-compose exec api sh -c "yarn test:e2e"
    ```
  But bear in mind that this command will run tests again your <b>main project database</b>, so this is not recommended way to do it.

- The second, recommended, way is to perform tests in new container with new database, with the command:
    ```shell
      $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up
    ```
    and this automatically create new containers for app and database in test mode, run the e2e tests in isolated env and database, and it will close and tear down at the end.


## Todos
- Enable global errors handling, decide the format of thrown errors/exceptions
